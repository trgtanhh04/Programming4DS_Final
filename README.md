# Final Project: Global Football Data Analysis 🌍⚽

## 📜 Description
This project is the **Final Project for Programming for Data Science** course, focusing on analyzing a global football dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains over 47,000 international football results from 1872 to 2024, covering FIFA World Cup, friendly matches, and other tournaments. The goal is to clean, explore, and analyze the data to uncover insights about football trends, team performance, and individual players.
